MasterTest - Contains all the most recent changes I have made to the code. I did copy some of them over but I'm not 100% f that was all of it. I will continue to version check once I get a clean install of arduino (make sure you get 1.8.0 and teensy 1.35 or you'll have problems). Use it to debug serial to serial communication.
